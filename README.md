Temples App
Introduction
This is part of Trisha's work as a Research Assistant! This project was developed as part of her journey in learning web development, and in updating the Temples App on Android. 
This Android application provides users with information about various temples around the world. Users can explore temple locations, view details about each temple, and interact with the map interface to navigate through different locations.

What I've Learned
During the development of this project, I've gained valuable knowledge and skills in several areas:

Android App Development: I've learned how to develop Android applications using Java and Android Studio, including UI design, layout creation, and activity lifecycle management.
Google Maps Integration: I've gained experience in integrating Google Maps into Android apps, including adding markers, customizing markers, and handling map interactions.
UI/UX Design: Through designing the user interface of the app, I've learned about UI/UX principles, including usability, accessibility, and user interaction design.
Version Control: I've used version control (e.g., Git) to manage project changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean project history.

Features
Map Interface: The app utilizes Google Maps to display temple locations on an interactive map.
Temple Listings: Users can view a list of temples along with their details such as name, location, and description.
Marker Customization: The app customizes markers on the map to represent each temple with an icon.
Popup Information: When users click on a marker, a popup window appears displaying detailed information about the selected temple.
Bottom Navigation: The app includes a bottom navigation bar for easy navigation between different views or features.

Future Improvements
User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system to personalize user experiences and access additional features.
Search Functionality: Add a search feature to allow users to search for specific temples by name or location.
Temple Details: Enhance temple details by providing additional information such as visiting hours, contact details, etc.
User Preferences: Implement settings or preferences to allow users to customize their temple viewing experience.
